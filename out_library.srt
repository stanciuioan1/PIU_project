0:5000| because now I know
5000:10000| how much do I will shred this universe
10000:15000| down to its last atom
15000:20000| Stone's you've collected for me create a new one
20000:25000| teeming life is not what it is last but
25000:30000| what it is been given
30000:35000| grateful universe blood
35000:40000| because you won't be alive to tell them
40000:45000| 
45000:47450|
